# Zero-Day-Network-Intrusion-Detector
The Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detector is a machine learning–based security system designed to identify previously unseen (zero-day) network attacks by analyzing abnormal patterns in network traffic. Unlike signature-based intrusion detection systems, this project focuses on behavioral and anomaly-based detection
