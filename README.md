# 🛡️ AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A complete Deep Learning based Network Intrusion Detection System built using:

- ✅ Autoencoder (Deep Learning)
- ✅ 90% Benign + 10% Attack Dataset
- ✅ Offline Traffic Replay Testing
- ✅ Real-time Streamlit Dashboard
- ✅ Anomaly vs Normal Detection
- ✅ Live Counters & Metrics

---

# Project Overview

This project detects malicious network traffic using an **Unsupervised deep learning Autoencoder model**.

Instead of training on attack data, the model is trained only on **normal (benign) traffic**, and it detects anomalies based on reconstruction error.

---

# How It Works

1. Train Autoencoder on normal traffic
2. Calculate reconstruction error
3. Set threshold using 95th percentile
4. During testing:
   - If error > threshold → 🚨 Attack
   - If error ≤ threshold → ✅ Normal

# 📊 Dataset Details

We generated a synthethic test dataset:

- **Total Rows:** 500
- **Benign Traffic:** ~ 450
- **Attack Traffic:** ~ 50

---

# Why this ratio for Attack dataset?

Real-world traffic mostly contains normal packets.

This distribution helps simulate realistic network behavior.

---

# 🛡 Why Autoencoder?

- Works without labeled attack data
- Learns normal behavior patterns
- Detects unknown attacks
- Useful for zero-day detection

---

# ⚙ Requirements

Typical libraries used:

```
tensorflow
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
streamlit
joblib
matplotlib
seaborn
```

---

# Future Improvements

- Real packet capture using Scapy
- Real-time IDS deployment
- Docker containerization
- Integration with firewall
- Alert system via email
- Cloud deployment

---

# Final Output

When running dashboard:

You will see:

- Total Packets: 500
- Normal Traffic
- Anomaly Traffic
- Replay stops automatically after completion
